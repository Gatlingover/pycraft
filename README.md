A fork of [foglemans "Minecfraft" repo](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft), intended to be more agressive in implementing new features, and sacrificing some of what makes the original good for teaching.

I plan to be very permissive in accepting pull-requests. The original had a ton
of people doing cool stuff with it, but that didn't fit the vision of it being
a learning tool.

Ultimately, I'd like to see this as a generic framework for building
complicated voxel/roguelike games. I'd like to see it implementing rules
similar to [GURPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS), but we're a long way off from that.

>The Generic Universal RolePlaying System, or GURPS, is a tabletop role-playing
game system designed to allow for play in any game setting.
